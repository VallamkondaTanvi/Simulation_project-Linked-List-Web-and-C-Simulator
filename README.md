This project is a Linked List Simulator implemented in two versions:


✔ A Web-based simulator (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for real-time visualization

✔ A C console simulator for understanding the underlying data structure


Both versions support insertion, deletion, searching, traversal, and visual representation of linked list nodes. This project is ideal for DSA learning, academic submissions, and portfolio-building.
